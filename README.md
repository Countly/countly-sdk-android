##What's Countly?
[Countly](http://count.ly) is an innovative, real-time, open source mobile analytics application. 
It collects data from mobile devices, and visualizes this information to analyze mobile application 
usage and end-user behavior. There are two parts of Countly: the server that collects and analyzes data, 
and mobile SDK that sends this data. Both parts are open source with different licensing terms.

##About

This repository includes the Countly Android SDK.

Need help? See [Countly SDK for Android](http://resources.count.ly/v1.0/docs/countly-sdk-for-android) documentation at [Countly Resources](http://resources.count.ly), or ask us on our [Countly Analytics Community Slack channel](http://slack.count.ly:3000/).

##Sample Android application

We have a beautiful Android application ([push notification sample app](https://github.com/Countly/countly-sdk-android/tree/master/app-messaging) and [analytics sample app](https://github.com/Countly/countly-sdk-android/tree/master/app)) which includes this SDK. Feel free to use this for testing purposes as you develop your application.
